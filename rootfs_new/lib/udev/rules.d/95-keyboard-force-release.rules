# Set model specific atkbd force_release quirk
#
# Several laptops have hotkeys which don't generate release events,
# which can cause problems with software key repeat.
# The atkbd driver has a quirk handler for generating synthetic
# release events, which can be configured via sysfs since 2.6.32.
# Simply add a file with a list of scancodes for your laptop model
# in /lib/udev/keymaps, and add a rule here.
# If the hotkeys also need a keymap assignment you can copy the
# scancodes from the keymap file, otherwise you can run
# /lib/udev/keymap -i /dev/input/eventX
# on a Linux vt to find out.
